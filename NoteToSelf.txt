6/28 -- I added Firebase to the app, I set up the GUI for a log in but for some reason the code is saying that "import FirebaseAuth" is not a thing.
Need to figure out why it is not working even though code is almost 1:1 to the SOS APP. 

Need to make a second controller to test the log in once it is done as well.

7/8 -- Finished the camp information section. The camp schedule can now be updated using firebase instead of hardcoding a schedule.

[KNOWN BUG] -- the user must tap on "Camp information", then "Home", then "Camp Information" for the schedule to show up.... Need to find why the data does not reload upon first tap
